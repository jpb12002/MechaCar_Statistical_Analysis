# Statistic and R
The data analytics team at AutosRUs is responsible for performing retrospective analysis of historical data, analytical validation and verification of current automotive specifications, and study design of future product testing. For this project, we used the R programming language to gather summary statistics for different variables and visualizations for different datasets. Once all the data is analyzed, we will provide our interpretation of the statistical test results. We also provided our own study design on how the AutosRUs manufacturing process could be more efficient.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
MechaCar_mpg is a dataset of 50 car prototypes that the team used to identify ideal vehicle MPG performance based on the following metrics: vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, and enabled AWD. A multiple linear regression model was used to predict which of these metrics (if any) had the most impact on vehicle MPG.
